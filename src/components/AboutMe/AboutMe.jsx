                subtitle="👋 I am a passionate and curious programmer who pursued my B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from International Islamic University Chittagong.
💻 Over the years, I've explored a variety of programming languages and technologies, including C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, React, and more.🌐 I particularly enjoy working on web development and am currently focused on specializing in the MERN Stack to build dynamic and scalable applications.🏏 When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the field playing cricket, where teamwork and strategy keep me energized and inspired. 🚀 I am dedicated to growing my skills and exploring innovative opportunities in the tech field, always eager to learn and take on new challenges." />
